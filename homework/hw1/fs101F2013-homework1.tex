After carefully reading Louis Menand's ``Live and Learn'' article from The New Yorker, prepare a pr\'{e}cis about this
text.  Your pr\'{e}cis should present, in condensed form, all of the key points and arguments that Menand makes. Along
with providing an informative title for your pr\'{e}cis, using no more than one page, and only including your own words,
you must summarize the central tenets of the article. As you complete this assignment, you must faithfully report the
arguments and claims in the text and resist the temptation to share your own interpretations and viewpoints.
