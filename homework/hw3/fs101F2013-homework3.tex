\end{center}

In past class sessions, you and your partner have developed a thesis statement and a title for a potential essay. Please
study these items to make sure that they carefully connect to the reading assignment and the theme of this module.
After you are convinced that the thesis statement meets the criteria in A Writer's Reference and the title adheres to
the guidelines that we have developed in class, please write a short two page essay that explores your thesis in greater
detail. As you are writing, you should focus on using concrete examples that illustrate your point.

Except for a peer leader, each member of a pair is responsible for writing an essay. As you are writing your essay, your
partner will serve as your editor.  In their capacity as editor, your partner will read and provide substantive comments
about your paper. Before turning in this assignment, you must meet with your editor at least once outside of our class
sessions. Please record the date and the elapsed time of the meeting(s) with your editor. Furthermore, you are
responsible for keeping and turning in all of the marked versions of your paper that the editor creates.

All students are encouraged to bring a draft of their materials to the Learning Commons and/or the instructor's office
hours in order to receive feedback on their writing assignment.
