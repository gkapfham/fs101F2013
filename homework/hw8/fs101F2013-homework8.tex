This assignment invites you to create an eight to ten page personal commentary on the theme ``Software Everywhere''.  To
complete this writing assignment, you should pick an interesting and controversial topic that is connected to the theme
of this course.  While students are encouraged to pick a subject that is different from those discussed in the previous
modules, this is not a requirement for this assignment. After choosing your topic, you should take a stand on the matter
and develop a title and a paper outline that will enable you to articulate and defend your view.

As you complete this assignment, please do not forget the importance of using the techniques from the three writing
texts that we have studied and discussed throughout the semester. For instance, you should consider ways in which you
can articulate and respond to the arguments of an individual who would disagree with your stance on the chosen issue.
You should also be careful to follow the writing rules and recommendations in the two other writing texts.  As an
example, you should organize your paper into paragraphs that each develop a single concept. 

When you are writing your article, please make sure that you correct all of the spelling, grammar, and formatting
errors. Your essay must contain at least one citation to either an article in the proceedings of a reputable conference
or journal or a book. Furthermore, your bibliography should consist of at least five high-quality sources and a
description of the meaning and importance of each source. You are also responsible for citing these articles directly in
the content of your article. Finally, your paper must furnish full bibliographic information for each source.

Students are invited to see the instructor if they have any questions about the due date or submission policy for
this assignment. Students are also encouraged to bring a draft of their paper to the Learning Commons and/or
the instructor's office hours in order to receive extra feedback on their writing assignment. Students should indicate
near their paper's pledge line whether they did or did not seek assistance from the instructor or a consultant in
the Learning Commons.
