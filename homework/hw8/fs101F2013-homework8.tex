This assignment invites you to complete a ten page ``portrait in piracy''.  


In this assignment, you must write a three to four page essay that analyzes any issue related to the theme of software
everywhere. For this final writing assignment, you should have at least three or four full pages of text, with the
bibliography and any other supplementary materials following in an attached appendix. While you are encouraged to reuse
some material from previous assignments, you should write a short appendix that carefully explains what content was
incorporated into this assignment. Even though it is suggested that you identify a topic related to one of our course
modules, you may pick another topic as long it closely connects to the theme of the course. As you complete this
assignment, please do not forget the importance of using the writing techniques from the three writing texts that we
have used throughout the semester. Finally, you should also remember the importance of taking a stand on your chosen
issue.

As in the previous writing assignments, you should create an interesting title that directly connects to the thesis of
your essay. You must organize your document into paragraphs that each develop a single concept. When you are writing
your article, please make sure that you correct all of the spelling, grammar, and formatting errors. You are also
required to type the assignment using a modern word processor (i.e., hand-written papers are not acceptable). Your essay
must contain at least one citation to either an article in the proceedings of a reputable conference or journal or a
book. Furthermore, your bibliography should consist of at least five high-quality sources and a description of the
meaning and importance of each source. You are also responsible for citing these articles directly in the content of
your article. Finally, you must turn in an appendix that furnishes full bibliographic information for each cited source.

Students are encouraged to see the Instructor if they have any questions about the due date or submission policy
for this assignment.

Finally, all students are encouraged to bring a draft of their materials to the Learning Commons and/or the instructor's
office hours in order to receive extra feedback on their writing assignment.
