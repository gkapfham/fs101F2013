\subsection*{Course Objectives}

Beyond the purpose of integrating new students into the intellectual life of Allegheny College, the goal of this course
is to ensure that students are able to effectively write and speak.  Using the theme of ``Software Everywhere'' as an
ends towards achieving these goals, students will learn to write and speak in a variety of styles and on a multitude of
subjects.  Students will also find out about the resources available to and rules and regulations upheld by students at 
Allegheny College.  Finally, students will learn how to competently interact with both their adviser and other
professors.

\subsection*{Class Policies}

\subsubsection*{Grading Policy}

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the
following categories. All percentages are approximate and it is possible
for the assigned percentages to change during the academic semester if a
need to do so presents itself. 

% <tr>
% <td> Class Participation </td><td>5%</td>
% </tr>
% 
% <tr>
% <td> Instructor and Peer Leader Meetings </td><td>5%</td>
% </tr>
% 
% <tr>
% <td>Short Writing and Presentation Assignments</td><td>60%</td>

% <tr>
% <td>Long Writing Assignments</td><td>10%</td>
% </tr>
% 
% <tr>
% <td>Final Paper</td><td>10%</td>

% 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Class Participation & 10\% \\
Instructor Meetings & 10\% \\
Short Writing Assignments & 50\% \\
Long Writing Assignments & 10\% \\
Presentation Assignments & 10\% \\
Final Examination & 10\%
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
Each of the these grading categories has the following definition:

\begin{itemize}

	\item {\em Class Participation}: All students are required to actively participate during
		all of the class sessions. Your participation will take forms such as answering questions about the required
		reading assignments, responding to comments made by members of the class, asking constructive questions of your 
		group members, giving presentations, and leading a discussion session. A student will receive an interim and
		final grade for this category.

	\item {\em Instructor Meetings}: All students are required to meet with the course instructor during office
		hours for a total of sixty minutes during the Fall 2013 semester.  These meetings must be scheduled through the
		course instructor's reservation system and documented on a meeting record that you submit on the day of the final
		examination.  Thirty minutes of these meetings must be devoted to an advising session during which the student
		will plan their schedule for the upcoming Spring 2014 academic semester.  Students must schedule their advising
		meeting no later than Friday, September 13, 2013; after picking a time for this meeting students should submit
		printed evidence of its existence to the course instructor.

	\item {\em Short and Long Writing Assignments}: Throughout this class, students will write a wide variety of short
		and long writing assignments.  While all assignments will be posted on the course Web site, students are
		responsible for submitting a printed and signed version of their assignment at the start of the class session on
		which the assignment is due.  To ensure that they can turn in a high quality paper, students must start writing
		and revising these assignments well in advance of the submission deadline.

	\item {\em Presentation Assignments}: Students will give several in-class presentations during this semester. While
		the assignment sheet will state the days on which the presentations will be given, the order in which students
		give their presentations will be randomly generated and revealed incrementally.  Unless there are severe
		extenuating circumstances, a failing grade will be given to students who are not in class on the day that they
		are invited to give their presentation.

	\item {\em Final Examination}: The final examination is a three-hour cumulative test.  By enrolling in this course,
		students agree that, unless there are extenuating circumstances, they will take the final examination at the
		time stated on the first page of the syllabus.  The final examination ensures that the students have a basic
		understanding of both the software-related topics and the writing and speaking skills that were the focus of the
		course.
	
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Assignment Submission}

All assignments will have a stated due date. The printed version of the assignment is to be turned in at the beginning
of the class on that due date; the printed materials must be dated and signed with the Honor Code pledge of all the
students in the group.  The electronic version of the assignment must be available to the course instructor in a version
control repository when the printed version is submitted. Late assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the
assigned due date with a 10\% penalty. All late assignments must be submitted at the beginning of the session that is
scheduled one week after the due date. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments
will be accepted after the late deadline. In addition to submitting the required deliverables for an assignment
completed in a group, students must turn in a one-page document that describes each group member's contribution to the
submitted deliverables.  

\subsubsection*{Attendance}

It is mandatory for all students to attend the class and laboratory sessions. If you will not be able to attend a
session, then please see the course instructor at least one week in advance to describe your situation.  Students who
miss more than five unexcused classes, laboratory sessions, or group project meetings will have their final grade in the
course reduced by one letter grade. Students who miss more than ten of the aforementioned events will automatically fail
the course.

% \subsection*{Laboratory Attendance Policy}
% 
% In order to acquired the proper skills in technical writing, critical reading, and the presentation of technical
% material, it is essential for students to have hands-on experience in a laboratory. Therefore, it is mandatory for all
% students to attend the laboratory sessions. If you will not be able to attend a laboratory, then please see the course
% instructors at least one week in advance in order to explain your situation. Students who miss more than two unexcused
% laboratories will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade.  Students who miss more than four
% unexcused laboratories will automatically fail the course.
% 

\subsubsection*{Use of Laboratory Facilities}

Throughout the semester, we will experiment with many different tools that software engineers use during the phases of
the software development life cycle.  The course instructor and the department's systems administrator have invested a
considerable amount of time to ensure that our laboratories support the completion of both the laboratory assignments and the
final project.  To this end, students are required to complete all assignments and the final project while using the
department's laboratory facilities. The course instructor and the systems administrator will only be able to devote a
limited amount of time to the configuration of a student's personal computer.

\subsubsection*{Class Preparation}

% The study of the computer science discipline is very challenging.  Students in this class will be challenged to learn
% the principles and practice of software development.  During the coming semester even the most diligent student will
% experience times of frustration when they are attempting to understand a challenging concept or complete a difficult
% laboratory assignment.  In many situations some of the material that we examine will initially be confusing : do not
% despair!  Press on and persevere!
% 

In order to minimize confusion and maximize learning, students must invest time to prepare for class discussions and
lectures.  During the class periods, the course instructor will often pose demanding questions that could require group
consultation, the creation of a program or test suite, a vote on a thought-provoking issue, or a group presentation.
Only students who have prepared for class by reading the assigned material and reviewing the current assignments will be
able to effectively participate in these discussions.  More importantly, only prepared students will be able to acquire
the knowledge and skills that are needed to be successful in both this course and the field of software development.  In
order to help students remain organized and effectively prepare for classes, the course instructor will maintain a class
schedule with reading assignments and presentation slides.   During the class sessions students will also be required to
download, use, and modify programs, diagrams, and data sets that are made available through the course Web site.
Students who are not comfortable with compiling, editing, and running Java programs should see the course instructor.

\subsubsection*{Disability Services}

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil
rights protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this legislation requires all students with
disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities.
Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability
Services at 332-2898.  Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons and is located in Pelletier Library.
Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

\subsubsection*{Honor Code}

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny
Course Catalogue.  The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit
requirements for graduation at Allegheny College.  This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations,
laboratory assignments, and the final project).  All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor
Program.  Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

\begin{quote}
I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the
integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.  
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Welcome to a Software Engineering Adventure}

In reference to software, Frederick Brooks, Jr.\ wrote in Chapter One of MMM, ``The magic of myth and legend has come true
in our time.'' Software is a pervasive aspect of our society that changes how we think and act.  High quality software
also has the potential to positively influence the lives of people. Moreover, the specification, design, implementation,
testing, maintenance, and documentation of software are exciting and rewarding activities!  At the start of this class,
I invite you to pursue this adventure in software engineering with enthusiasm and vigor.
