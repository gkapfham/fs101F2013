<h3>Course Catalog Description</h3>

<p>
An examination of the pervasive nature of computer software and the
impact that computer technology has on society. Drawing on articles
from the popular press and the computer science literature, this
course examines the technical and ethical challenges that face a
culture that regularly uses computer software applications. Sample
topics include the Internet, Google, online music, open source
software, electronic commerce, social networking, and data
mining. Coursework emphasizes the development of effective oral and
written communication skills with a focus on description, summary, and
critical thinking.
</p>

<h3>Grading Policies</h3>

<p>
The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on class
participation, attendance at instructor and peer leader meetings, the
grades on the final exam and final paper, the grades for all of the
short writing and presentation assignments, and the grades for the
long writing assignments.  The grade breakdown will follow the form

<h3>Instructor Meeting Policy</h3>

<p>
All students are required to meet individually with the professor in
order to discuss their status in the class and work towards improving
their writing and speaking skills.  During these meetings, which must
be scheduled to take place during my office hours, students will
participate in brainstorming, writing, and/or editing sessions with
the professor.  Every student must also meet with the instructor at
the end of the semester for an advising session to select your classes
for the Spring 2013 semester.  By the end of the semester, each
student is required to have met with the instructor for a total of, at
minimum, one-hundred-and-twenty minutes.  Students are also
responsible for both maintaining a record of their instructor meetings
and submitting this record on the day of the final examination.
</p>

<h3>Peer Leader Meeting Policy</h3>

<p>
One or more of the peer leaders will hold weekly office hours in Alden
Hall. All students are required to meet with a peer leaders on a
minimum of five separate occasions.  Students may use these meeting
times to discuss the reading assignments, ask questions about the
computers in the Computer Science Department's laboratories, or learn
more about the software that we will use throughout the semester.
Students are also responsible for both maintaining a record of their
peer leader meetings and submitting this record on the day of the
final examination.
</p>

<h3>Assignment Submission Policy</h3>

<p>
All assignments will have a given due date.  The printed version of
the assignment is to be turned in at the beginning of the class on
that due date.  Late assignments will be accepted for up to one week
past the assigned due date with a 10% penalty.  All late assignments
must be submitted at the beginning of the class that is scheduled one
week after the given due date.  Unless special arrangements are made
with the instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late
deadline.
</p>

<h3>Class Attendance Policy</h3>

<p>
It is <strong>mandatory</strong> for all students to attend class.  If
you will not be able to attend a class session, then please see the
instructor at least one week in advance to describe your situation.
Students who miss more than five unexcused classes will have their
final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade.  Students who
miss more than ten unexcused classes will automatically fail the
course.
</p>

<h3>Preparation for Class Sessions</h3>

<p>
The study of writing, speaking, software, and the theme <em>software
everywhere</em> can be very challenging.  During the coming semester
even the most diligent student will experience times of frustration
when they are attempting to understand a challenging concept, complete
a difficult writing assignment, or prepare for an upcoming
presentation.  In many situations some of the concepts and ideas that
we discuss will initially be confusing : do not despair!  Press on and
persevere!
</p>

<p>
In order to minimize confusion, students must invest time to get ready
for class discussions and lectures.  During our class periods, the
instructor will often pose challenging questions that could require
group consultation, the creation of a presentation, or a vote on an
interesting issue.  Only students who have prepared for class by
reading the assigned material and reviewing the short writing and
presentation assignments will be able to effectively participate in
these discussions.  More importantly, only prepared students will be
able to extract the knowledge that is needed to be successful in this
course and later writing and speaking courses at Allegheny College.
</p>

<p>
In order to help students remain organized and effectively prepare for
classes, the instructor will maintain a class schedule with reading
assignments and additional notes and resources. The writing and
presentation assignments will be directly integrated into the class
schedule.  Throughout the class sessions, students will also be
required to download and use software applications, visit and read Web
sites, use software tools to conduct experiments and investigate new
concepts, and leverage traditional computer programs to prepare
written documents and presentations.  Students who are not familiar
with traditional word-processing and presentation software should see
the instructor immediately.
</p>

<p>  
Remember this motto, <em>semper paratus</em>!
</p>

<h3>Disability Services</h3>

<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal
anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights
protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this
legislation requires all students with disabilities be guaranteed a
learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of
their disabilities.  Students with disabilities who believe they may
need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability
Services at +1 814-332-2898.  Disability Services is part of the
Learning Commons and is located in Pelletier Library.  Please do this
as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are
implemented in a timely fashion.
</p>
